## An Important Note About Support

SuperSticky (in common with all of my ExpressionEngine add-ons) is no longer officially supported.

The code is well-documented, and you're free to fork the repo if you'd like to make some changes or improvements (it's distributed under a liberal open source license).

Hopefully this will be everything you need to use this add-on in your projects, but if not please don't email me asking for support; I don't even have ExpressionEngine installed locally any more.

## Overview
ExpressionEngine's "sticky" channel entries are handy for "always important" pieces of content, but lack the flexibility to be really useful. That's where SuperSticky comes in.

With SuperSticky you can make a channel entry sticky for a set period of time, or specific member groups (or both).
